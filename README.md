# virtual-coffee-shop
Project to create a virtual Coffee Shop for a Coffee Shop Chain moving operations to the cloud for scalability and reliability of their website and backend

It's all about achieving the expansion of Virtual Coffee Shop chain to the AWS Cloud Platform in order to ensure that the business attains high scalability and resilience as they migrate to the cloud.

The creation of a virtual coffee shop on AWS was achieved by creating a VPC and 2 subnets (1 public and 1 private) with EC2 instances in the public subnet and Application Load Balancer to ensure smooth and balanced flow of traffic across multiple instances grouped into a specified target group to provide maximum throughput and availability.
